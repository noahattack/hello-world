# hello-world
I'm following the tutorial on ==GitHub== for a first repository project.
1. I'm trying to learn code because it interests me and I can make a living out of it
2. **I love tech** and if I can learn how to write programs and apps that make use out of it I think its satisfying becuase its like a *complete circle*.
3. I'm trying to use the markdown elements to make enforce my learning.
